Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables. (3A-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Use and adapt classic algorithms to solve computational problems. (3B-AP-10) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
